### Welcone to Twenty-One (BlackJack)

## This project was published on 12/17/2025

## This program is a simulation of Black Jack where it tells you your safety percentage of hitting/dealing a card.

## To play, run TwentyOne.cpp and follow instructions of the menu.
## Basic Synopsis: Input 'r' for rules, 'p to play, 'h' to hit, 's' to stand.

## Head's up: the split function hasn't been implemented due to it's difficulty. I was unable to make a final function for it before the project due date.

## When you are playing the rounds, give the program about 5 seconds to load up the next round so you can view the results of your last played round.
